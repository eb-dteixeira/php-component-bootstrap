## Setup

### Composer

You can download and install composer running ```tools/install-composer.sh```. It will be installed to the repository's base directory, and can be executed with ```php composer.phar```.

You can install a specific composer version by running ```COMPOSER_VERSION=1.0.0-alpha10 tools/install-composer-sh```. By editing **tools/install-composer.sh** you can fix a specific version of composer to always be downloaded for your project.

By default **composer.json** is configured to download PHPUnit. Before using PHPUnit you should edit **tests/bootstrap.php** and change ```<<TEST_TOP_LEVEL_NAMESPACE>>``` to the top namespace of your test code (by default the PSR-4 standard is used).
